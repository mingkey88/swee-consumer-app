## üé® Enhanced User Experience

### Conversation Examples

**Initial Greeting:**
```
AI: "Hi Sarah! üëã I see it's been about 3 weeks since your last hair appointment 
at The Hair Lounge. Based on your usual 4-week cycle, you might be ready for 
your next cut and color. Would you like me to check their availability?"
```

**Trust-Aware Recommendation:**
```
AI: "I found 3 great salons for your balayage. The Hair Studio has a 95% trust 
score and specializes in your hair type - they're known for transparent pricing 
and no hard-selling. Would you like to see their availability?"
```

**Budget-Conscious Suggestion:**
```
AI: "I notice you usually spend around $80-120 for facials. I found a new spa 
within your budget that's highly rated for anti-aging treatments. Plus, with 
your current points, you could get a $15 discount!"
```

### Smart Features

1. **Context Switching**: "Let me check your previous bookings to suggest similar services"
