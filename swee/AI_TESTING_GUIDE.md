### Step 3: Test Different Conversations

**Example conversations to try:**

**For Bella Chen:**
- "I need a haircut" â†’ AI should mention her frizz/dryness concerns
- "What's my budget again?" â†’ Should reference $80-120 range
- "I'm worried about pushy sales" â†’ Should acknowledge her bad experiences

**For Jessica Wong:**  
- "My skin has been breaking out" â†’ Should connect to her acne concerns
- "I'm on a tight budget" â†’ Should reference her $50-80 student budget
- "Find me a facial" â†’ Should suggest treatments for oily skin

**For Sarah Chen:**
- "I need anti-aging treatments" â†’ Should reference her executive lifestyle
- "Something premium please" â†’ Should suggest higher-end options
- "I hate hard selling" â†’ Should emphasize trust scores strongly

### Step 4: Watch for Personalization

The AI should demonstrate:

âœ… **Memory of preferences** - References quiz answers  
âœ… **Budget awareness** - Stays within user's range  
âœ… **Lifestyle matching** - Suggests appropriate services  
âœ… **Trust integration** - Emphasizes safety for concerned users  
âœ… **Points awareness** - Mentions current level and points

## ðŸŽ­ Expected AI Behaviors

### **Bella Chen Conversation:**
```
"Hi Bella! As a professional who prefers monthly hair appointments, I know you value looking polished for work. Given your concerns about frizz and color damage, and your $80-120 budget, I found some excellent salons with high trust scores..."
```

### **Jessica Wong Conversation:**  
```
"Hey Jessica! I see you're focused on facial treatments for acne and dark spots. With your bi-weekly routine and $50-80 student budget, I found some great options that specialize in oily skin treatments..."
```

### **Sarah Chen Conversation:**
```
"Hello Sarah! Given your executive lifestyle and preference for multiple services, I know you value premium experiences. With your concerns about hard-selling and need for anti-aging treatments, let me show you our most trusted, high-end providers..."
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If AI responses seem generic:
1. **Check sign-in** - Make sure you're signed in as one of the test users
2. **Verify data** - The users should have quiz answers and preferences
3. **Try specific questions** - Ask about budget, concerns, or preferences directly
4. **Check console** - Look for any API errors in browser dev tools

## ðŸŽŠ Success Indicators

You'll know the AI is working perfectly when:
- It greets you by name and mentions your specific preferences
- It references your budget range without you mentioning it
- It suggests services that match your quiz concerns  
- It acknowledges your trust/hard-selling preferences
- It mentions your points and gamification level
- It provides contextual suggestions based on your profile

The AI should feel like it truly **knows** each user and provides personalized, intelligent assistance based on their individual data!
