# Fresha-Style Booking Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a Fresha-inspired booking flow for the Swee consumer app, following modern UX patterns and design principles.

## Design Philosophy

### Fresha Analysis
Based on analysis of Fresha's provider pages (e.g., Kosme Aesthetics - Plaza Singapura), the key design elements include:

1. **Clean Hero Section**: Large hero image with provider name and key info overlay
2. **Single Call-to-Action**: One prominent "Book Now" button instead of multiple competing actions
3. **Service List**: Clean service cards with price and duration, no individual booking buttons
4. **Separate Booking Flow**: Clicking "Book Now" takes users to a dedicated booking interface
5. **Progressive Steps**: Clear step-by-step booking process
6. **Minimal Friction**: Reduced cognitive load with focused interactions

## Implementation

### 1. Updated Provider Detail Page (`/providers/[id]/page.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Hero Section**: Maintained the existing hero with gradient overlay and provider info
- **Single Book Now Button**: Replaced multiple action buttons with one centered "Book Now" button
- **Service Cards**: Removed individual "Book" buttons from service cards
- **Clean Layout**: Services now show price and duration without booking clutter
- **Consistent Navigation**: All booking flows now route through the dedicated booking page

**Key Features:**
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Dark mode support
- Trust indicators (ratings, reviews, trust score)
- Contact information sidebar
- Opening hours display

### 2. New Booking Flow Page (`/providers/[id]/booking/page.tsx`)

**Architecture:**
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: 3 clear steps - Service Selection → Date & Time → Confirmation
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress bar showing current step
- **Service Pre-selection**: Supports pre-selecting services via URL params
- **Responsive Layout**: 2-column layout with booking form and provider info sidebar

**Step Details:**

#### Step 1: Service Selection
- List all available services
- Clear pricing and duration display
- Service descriptions and categories
- Click-to-select interaction with visual feedback

#### Step 2: Date & Time Selection
- **Date Selection**: Next 7 days displayed as a grid
- **Time Slot Selection**: Available time slots with availability status
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected date/time highlighted in brand colors
- **Back/Next Navigation**: Easy navigation between steps

#### Step 3: Confirmation
- **Booking Summary**: Complete booking details review
- **Provider Information**: Consistent provider context
- **Final Confirmation**: Clear call-to-action to complete booking

### 3. Design System Integration

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: Orange (#f97316) - Swee brand color
- Secondary: Gray variants for neutral elements
- Success: Green for confirmations
- Warning: Yellow for attention items

**Typography:**
- Clear hierarchy with consistent font sizes
- Readable text with proper contrast ratios
- Bold headings for section clarity

**Spacing:**
- Consistent padding and margins
- Generous white space for clean look
- Responsive grid system

## User Experience Flow

### Provider Page Experience
1. User arrives at provider page from search or direct link
2. Immediately sees hero image and provider key information
3. Scrolls to view services, reviews, and provider details
4. When ready to book, clicks the single "Book Now" button
5. Navigates to dedicated booking flow

### Booking Flow Experience
1. **Service Selection**: Choose from available services
2. **Date & Time**: Select preferred appointment slot
3. **Confirmation**: Review and confirm booking details
4. **Completion**: Proceed to payment/confirmation flow

## Technical Implementation

### Routing Structure
```
/providers/[id] - Provider detail page
/providers/[id]/booking - Booking flow page
/providers/[id]/booking?service=X - Pre-selected service booking
```

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- URL parameters for service pre-selection
- LocalStorage for booking data persistence
- API integration for real-time availability

### Data Flow
- Provider data fetched from `/api/merchants/[id]`
- Service selection stored in component state
- Booking data compiled and stored for confirmation
- Final booking submitted via `/api/bookings`
